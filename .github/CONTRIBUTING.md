# How you can contribute to mizer development

## Use the issue tracker

If you have any 

* question about mizer,
* problem while using mizer,
* report of a bug in mizer,
* idea for something that could be added or made better in mizer, 

please do not hesitate letting us know by creating a new issue at
<https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/issues/>.
Or you can drop us a line at
[mizer@sizespectrum.org](mailto::mizer@sizespectrum.org) or make a post on the
[size-spectrum discussion
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/size-spectrum-models).

## Improve the documentation

Errors, shortcomings or any comment on the documentation can also be submited as
an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/issues/).

In case you know how to correct the error or make the improvement yourself, you
can also help us by editing the page. At the top of most documentation pages
there is a link to the page source on GitHub. There the page will have an "Edit
this file" button that looks like a pencil. Click this an edit the page. When
you save your edits GitHub guides you through the process of creating a pull
request for your edits, which will make it super-easy for us to merge your
suggestions.

So even small contributions like the removal of a simple typo are very welcome.


## Contribute an example

If you have set up a **mizer** model for your area of interest or your research
question, please share it with us. The best place to do that is in the
**[MizerExamples](https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizerExamples)** package.
Start by creating an issue at that package's issue tracker or just send an email
to [mizer@sizespectrum.org](mailto::mizer@sizespectrum.org). We will then
discuss how to best integrate your example into that package to make it useful
to others.


## Contribute code

We are more than happy to receive [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you have new
code or a bug fix. Your contribution will be appreciated by the community. If it
is a new feature, the best place to submit it is as a pull request to the
**[MizerExperimental](https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizerExperimental)**
package. There the feature can mature until it is ready to be incorporated
either into the core mizer package or into one of its extension packages.

## Increase mizer usage and awareness

Do not forget to mention the use of **mizer** in any of your documents and
publications. Use

```
citation('mizer')
```

to get citation info for the main reference for mizer. You can also link to our
website <https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/> so readers can find out more about the
project.
