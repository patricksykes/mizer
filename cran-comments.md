## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have added trailing slashes to two
URLs in the README file.

## Test environments
  
* ubuntu 18.04 bionic, R 4.0.2

0 errors ✓ | 0 warnings ✓ | 1 note x

The note is not due to a problem in the package but due to a problem with
the time server, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63613301/r-cmd-check-note-unable-to-verify-current-time
  
* win-builder (devel, release and oldrelease)
  No Notes, Warnings or Errors
